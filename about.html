                I grew up in a small new hampshire town named Hollis. I attended
                both Northeastern University and Embry Riddle where I learned
                how to fly a plane. Learning how to fly was one of my greatest
                achievements in life. Although I loved flying it would not end
                up being my career. I landed my first professional job at Bank
                of Boston after my son was born. Soon I would enter into the
                world of technology where I built my first Microsoft Access
                application.

                I joined a program that taught a selected group of us how to
                code cobol. This was needed to change the date field in
                applications from two year to four year dates. After that
                project was done I moved in to Microsoft's ASP.Net programming
                language. I maintained numerous internal intranet sites using
                asp.net for many years. After doing this I moved into a
                leadership role as a scrum master which is what I am currently
                doing. My ambition is to be a full stack web developer by
                completing by Web Development degree at Bellevue University.

          I like to travel. I like to go on trips with my family or just with my
          wife. The pictures are from my recent trip to Barbados with my wife.
          That country is so beautiful. I like to take my family to Martha's
          Vineyard and to Florida to visit family.
